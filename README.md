# Challenge 01

## *Step#1*

#### Go to **csharp**  -> **GildedRose.cs** -> `UpdateQuality()` function 


## *Step#2*

### **Challenge Requirement**

#### find the code Smell in the function `UpdateQuality()` and Refactor the function.
##### your repo should contain a README file and the refactored function.

- README file contains:

Code Smell:

- Duplicated Code: identical or very similar code that exists in more than one location.

- Long Function: A method has too many lines of code, making it hard to understand




Solution: using call functions to reduce duplicate code


> p.s. your refactored function have to work just like how the old `UpdateQuality()` function was working
