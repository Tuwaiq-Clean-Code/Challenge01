# Challenge 01

## *Step#1*

#### Go to **csharp**  -> **GildedRose.cs** -> `UpdateQuality()` function 


## *Step#2*

### **Challenge Requirement**

#### find the code Smell in the function `UpdateQuality()` and Refactor the function.
##### your repo should contain a README file and the refactored function.

- README file contains:

Code Smell: Long Method

Definition: Too much unnecessary code in a method

Solution: Extract functions and remove unnecessary code

Code Smell: Duplicate Code

Definition: A piece of code that is repeatedly used

Solution: Extract as a function

Code Smell: Arrow Code

Definition: Deep nested ifs

Solution: Combine conditions in a single 'if' if possible 


> p.s. your refactored function have to work just like how the old `UpdateQuality()` function was working
