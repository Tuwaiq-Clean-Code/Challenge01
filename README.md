# Challenge 01


## Code Smell:

### 1- 

<img src = "1Before.png" />

### 2- 
<img src = "2Before.png" />
Definition: 

- Duplicated Code and Logic: 
Duplicated code is considered one of the worse code smells. Beyond blatant copy paste, there are subtle duplications like parallel inheritance hierarchies and repetitive code structures.
Why itâ€™s bad? Makes code more difficult to maintain.
- Long Method:
Long code components take time to read and fully understand. Why itâ€™s bad? Hurts code readability and reusability.


## Solution:

Delete unnecessary if statement and aggregate all items' names in an array, and compare just one time.


### 1- 

<img src = "1After.png" />

### 2- 
<img src = "2After.png" />

## Output:
<img src="Output.png" />
