# The Code Smells are:

1- Duplicate Code

2- Bloaters

3- Change Preventers

4- Long method



# Definition: 

1- Duplicate Code : Don’t repeat yourself the code shoud not be Duplicated in the function instead you can do one 
function and call it so when you fix the code you dont have to search through the code just change the method.

2- Bloaters : Methods and classes that have increased to such proportions that they are hard to work with.

3- Change Preventers : It mean if you need to change something in one place in your code, you have to make many changes in other places too.

4- Long method : The method we edit has too many responsibilities.


# Solution:

The solution was by refactoring the code and replace the duplicate codes with functions to not repeat the code.
Also making functions for every task, not one function for all tasks in the class to organize the code. 
Easly doing updates on the application, and working as a group won't be a problem if the code was clean.
