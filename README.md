# Challenge 01

### Code Smell:
Conditional Statements 
### Definition:
Redundant and avoidable conditional statements are a Code Smell.
These allow us to selectively execute code based on conditional logic. Overusing conditionals results in code that is hard to understand and difficult to modify.
Sometimes we canâ€™t avoid having multiple if-else/switch statements in our code as our code flow required it be there to handle various scenarios based on different conditions.
### Solution:
Minimize nested if and otherwise else if reasonable .
